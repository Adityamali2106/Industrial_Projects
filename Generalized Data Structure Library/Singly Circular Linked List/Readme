# Singly Circular Linked List Manager
A high-performance, template-based C++ implementation of a Singly Circular Linked List. This project utilizes
Generic Programming to provide a versatile data structure capable of handling various primitive data types
(Integer, Character, Float, Double) through a single, unified codebase.

# Overview
This application implements a circular linear data structure where the traversal is unidirectional but infinite,
as the tail of the list is linked back to the head. By leveraging C++ templates, the system ensures strict type
safety while allowing the user to decide the data format at runtime. The architecture follows modular programming
principles, splitting the declaration, implementation, and user interface into distinct files.

# Key Features
Circular Unidirectional Traversal: Support for continuous looping through the list, effectively eliminating "null" terminations.
Generic Architecture: Implemented using C++ templates to support multiple data types (int, char, float, double) seamlessly.
Dynamic Operations: Full support for insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, or any specific position within the list.
Analytical Functions: Built-in tools to search for the first, last, or all occurrences of specific data.\
Structural Modification: Features a physical reverse algorithm that reorders the actual pointers of the circular list.
Memory Management: Comprehensive cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks by deallocating all nodes upon request.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into three distinct layers:
Singly_Circular_Linked_List.hpp: The header file containing the node and list class declarations.
Singly_Circular_Linked_List.cpp: The implementation file containing the algorithmic logic for circular list manipulations.
main.cpp: The client interface containing the menu-driven system and the entry point of the application.

# Usage
Type Selection: Upon startup, enter the desired data type (e.g., Integer, Charactor, float, or Double).
Operation Menu: Choose from 15 available operations, including node insertion, deletion, searching, and physical reversal.
Feedback: The program provides clear console output for every action, including list state displays and current node counts.
