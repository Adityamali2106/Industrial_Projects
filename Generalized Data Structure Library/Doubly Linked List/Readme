# Generic Doubly Linked List
A high-performance, template-based C++ implementation of a Doubly Linked List. This project utilizes Generic Programming 
to provide a versatile data structure capable of handling various primitive data types (Integer, Character, Float, Double)
through a single, unified codebase.

# Overview
This application implements a bidirectional linear data structure. By leveraging C++ templates, the system ensures 
strict type safety while allowing the user to decide the data format at runtime. The architecture follows a clean 
separation of concerns, splitting the declaration, implementation, and user interface into modular files.

# Key Features
Bidirectional Traversal: Support for moving both forward and backward through the list using next and previous pointers.
Generic Architecture: Implemented using C++ templates to support multiple data types seamlessly.
Dynamic Operations: Full support for insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, or any specific position within the list.
Analytical Functions: Built-in tools to search for first, last, or all occurrences of specific data.
Structural Modification: Features a physical reverse algorithm that reorders the actual pointers of the list.
Memory Management: Comprehensive cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks by deallocating all nodes upon request.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into three distinct layers:
Doubly_Linked_List.hpp: The header file containing the DoublyLLLnode and DoublyLLL class declarations.
Doubly_Linked_List.cpp: The implementation file containing the algorithmic logic for all list manipulations.
main.cpp: The client interface containing the menu-driven system and the entry point of the application.

# Usage
Type Selection: Upon startup, enter the desired data type (e.g., Integer, Charactor, float, or Double).
Operation Menu: Choose from 15 available operations, including node insertion, deletion, searching, and list reversal.
Feedback: The program provides clear console output for every action, including list state displays and node counts.
