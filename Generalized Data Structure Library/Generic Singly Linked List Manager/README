Generic Singly Linked List Manager
A robust, template-based C++ implementation of a Singly Linked List. This project demonstrates a Generic Programming approach,
allowing a single codebase to manage various primitive data types dynamically at runtime.

Overview
This application provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing a linear data structure. By utilizing C++ templates, the
system ensures type safety and memory efficiency while supporting operations on different data formats like integers, characters, 
and floating-point numbers.

Key Features
Type Flexibility: Support for multiple data types using a single generic class structure.
Dynamic Node Management: Tools for adding and removing data at any position within the list.
Advanced Traversal: Capabilities for displaying data in forward and reverse order.
Structural Manipulation: Functionality to physically reorder the structure of the list.
Analytical Tools: Integrated search and counting capabilities to monitor list content and occurrences.
Memory Safety: Built-in mechanisms for total cleanup and individual node deallocation.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three distinct layers to follow modular programming principles:
singly_linked_list.hpp:   Contains the structure of the data nodes and the interface for the list manager.
singly_linked_list.cpp:   Contains the detailed algorithmic logic for all list operations.
main.cpp:                 A terminal-based user interface that routes user input to the appropriate list logic based on the chosen data type.

Usage
Select Data Type: Choose the type of data you wish to store (e.g., Integer, Float).
Navigate Menu: Use the numbered menu system to perform operations like insertion, deletion, or searching.

Observe Results: The application provides real-time feedback on the state of the list after every operation.
