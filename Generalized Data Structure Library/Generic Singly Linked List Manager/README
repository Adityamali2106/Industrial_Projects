Generic Singly Linked List Manager
A robust, template-based C++ implementation of a Singly Linked List. This project demonstrates a Generic Programming approach, allowing a single codebase to manage various primitive data types dynamically at runtime.

🚀 Overview
This application provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing a linear data structure. By utilizing C++ templates, the system ensures type safety and memory efficiency while supporting operations on different data formats like integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.

✨ Key Features
Type Flexibility: Support for multiple data types using a single generic class structure.

Dynamic Node Management: Tools for adding and removing data at any position within the list.

Advanced Traversal: Capabilities for displaying data in forward and reverse order.

Structural Manipulation: Functionality to physically reorder the structure of the list.

Analytical Tools: Integrated search and counting capabilities to monitor list content and occurrences.

Memory Safety: Built-in mechanisms for total cleanup and individual node deallocation.

🛠 Project Structure
The project is organized into three distinct layers to follow modular programming principles:

singly_linked_list.hpp: Contains the structure of the data nodes and the interface for the list manager.

singly_linked_list.cpp: Contains the detailed algorithmic logic for all list operations.

main.cpp: A terminal-based user interface that routes user input to the appropriate list logic based on the chosen data type.

💻 Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (GCC 7.0+ or Clang recommended)

Support for the C++17 standard

Compilation
To compile the multi-file project, use the following command in your terminal:

Bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp singly_linked_list.cpp -o LinkedListApp
Execution
Run the compiled executable:

Bash
./LinkedListApp
📝 Usage
Select Data Type: Choose the type of data you wish to store (e.g., Integer, Float).

Navigate Menu: Use the numbered menu system to perform operations like insertion, deletion, or searching.

Observe Results: The application provides real-time feedback on the state of the list after every operation.
