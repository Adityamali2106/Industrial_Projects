# Generic Doubly Circular Linked List
A high-performance, template-based C++ implementation of a Doubly Circular Linked List. This project utilizes Generic Programming
to provide a versatile data structure capable of handling various primitive data types (Integer, Character, Float, Double) through 
a single, unified codebase.

# Overview
This application implements a circular bidirectional linear data structure where the last node points back to the first and
the first node points back to the last. By leveraging C++ templates, the system ensures strict type safety while allowing the 
user to decide the data format at runtime. The architecture follows modular programming principles, splitting the declaration,
implementation, and user interface into distinct files.

# Key Features
Circular Bidirectional Traversal: Support for continuous looping through the list in both forward and backward directions.
Generic Architecture: Implemented using C++ templates to support multiple data types (int, char, float, double) seamlessly.
Dynamic Operations: Full support for insertion and deletion at the beginning, end, or any specific position within the list.
Analytical Functions: Built-in tools to search for the first, last, or all occurrences of specific data.
Structural Modification: Features a physical reverse algorithm that reorders the actual pointers of the list.
Memory Management: Comprehensive cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks by deallocating all nodes upon request.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into three distinct layers:
Doubly_Circular_linked_list.hpp: The header file containing the DoublyCLLnode and DoublyCLL class declarations.
Doubly_Circular_linked_list.cpp: The implementation file containing the algorithmic logic for all circular list manipulations.
main.cpp: The client interface containing the menu-driven system and the entry point of the application.

# Usage
Type Selection: Upon startup, enter the desired data type (e.g., Integer, Charactor, float, or Double).
Operation Menu: Choose from 15 available operations, including node insertion, deletion, searching, and list reversal.
Feedback: The program provides clear console output for every action, including list state displays and node counts.
