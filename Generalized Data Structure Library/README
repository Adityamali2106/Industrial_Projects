#C++ Generalized Data Structure Library
A robust, template-based C++ library providing generic implementations of essential data structures. 
This project demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Template
Programming, and manual Memory Management.

#Overview
This library provides a "Generalised Approach," allowing the data structures to handle any data type 
(int, char, float, double, or custom objects) using C++ templates. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit
for developers needing efficient, reusable data management components.

#Features
The library includes full implementations for the following structures:

# Linear Data Structures 
## Linked Lists
Singly Linear Linked List: Standard node-based list with forward traversal.

Singly Circular Linked List: Last node points back to the first, ideal for circular buffering.

Doubly Linear Linked List: Nodes contain pointers to both next and previous elements.

Doubly Circular Linked List: Bidirectional traversal with a circular structure.

Stack: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) implementation with push, pop, and peep operations.

Queue: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) implementation with enqueue and dequeue operations.

# Technical Highlights
Generic Programming: Utilizes template <class T> to ensure type independence.

Manual Memory Management: Efficient use of new and delete operators to prevent memory leaks.

OOP Principles: Strict adherence to Encapsulation (private/public members) and Abstraction.
