File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption
Technology: Java Programming

#• Project Overview
    • This project is a Java-based file utility tool that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a 
      single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved.
    • To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt & extract the data.
    • The project also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

#• Key Features
    • File Packing : 
          ◦ Combines multiple regular files into a single archive file.
          ◦ Stores metadata (file name, size, timestamp) along with file content.
    • File Unpacking :
          ◦ Extracts individual files from the packed archive.
          ◦ Restores all original metadata and file structure.

    • Data Security
          ◦ Built-in encryption and decryption to protect packed files.
    
    • Graphical User Interface (GUI)
          ◦ User-friendly GUI built in Java (Swing).
          ◦ Provides simple options for selecting files, encrypting, packing, and unpacking.
    • Cross-platform
          ◦ Runs seamlessly on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
# • Learning Outcomes
    • Practical experience with Java I/O Streams and File Handling APIs.
    • Implementation of metadata management during file operations.
    • Strong understanding of encryption/decryption techniques in Java.
    • Hands-on experience with GUI development (Swing).
    • Insight into archiving and compression utilities (similar to ZIP/TAR).
