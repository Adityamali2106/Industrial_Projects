Kernel Interface Utility Suite

Technology: C Programming, Linux System Programming, Native System Calls

• Project Overview
    • This project is a custom-built Kernel Interface Utility Suite that programmatically implements major Linux commands using native system calls.
    • Instead of relying on existing GNU utilities, we developed our own versions of important commands to understand their internal working at the OS level.
    • All commands are enhanced with additional features for improved user interaction and customization.
    • The executables are integrated into the system path, replacing default utilities for learning purposes,and each command is uniquely 
      identified with the postfix letter "x" (e.g., 1sx, pwdx, cpx).
    • This project densonstrates deep understanding of Linux internals, system calls, file systems, and process management.

• System-Level Integration

    • All executables compiled and placed in system path
    • Commands usable directly from terminal
    • Postfix naming convention (x)
    • Executable permissions properly managed

• Architecture Design

    • Modular implementation (one command per file)
    • Common utility module for shared functions
    • System call abstraction where required
    • Structured error reporting
    • 
• Learning Outcomes

    • Deep understanding of Linux system calls
    • Clear knowledge of how Linux commands actually work internally
    • File descriptor management
    • Directory handling and inode concepts
    • Process creation and execution flow
    • Memory and resource management
    • Building real system utilities from scratch
    • Understanding PATH variable and executable resolution
    • Hands-on exposure to OS-level programming
