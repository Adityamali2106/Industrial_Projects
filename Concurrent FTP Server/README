                            Concurrent FTP Server Multi-Client File Transfer System
Technology: C Programming (Linux System Programming)

Project Overview
      This project is a Concurrent FTP Server implemented in C on Linux that enables multiple clients to connect 
to a server and download files concurrently. The server uses socket programming and process management to support
parallel file transfers.
      It provides a strong practical understanding of Linux networking, file subsystem, process subsystem, and building a
simple protocol-driven client-server system.

Key Features
    • Multi-Client Support (Concurrency)
          • Handles multiple clients at the same time.
          • Uses process-based concurrency (fork()) to create a separate child process per client connection.
    • File Transfer over TCP
          • Uses TCP socket communication to ensure reliable transfer.
          • Client requests a file name, server validates and sends it.
    • Simple Protocol Design (Header + Data)
          • Implements a clean protocol like:
                ◦ Server first sends a header (example: OK <size>\n or error message)
                ◦ Then transmits the file in chunks using read() and write()
          • Helps students learn real protocol design used in networking systems.
    • Linux System Call Usage (Core Focus)
          • File subsystem: open, read, close, stat
          • Network subsystem: socket, bind, listen, accept, connect, send, recv
          • Process subsystem: fork, wait, exit
• Proper Error Handling
    • Handles cases like:
          ◦ File not found
          ◦ Client disconnect
          ◦ Invalid requests
          ◦ Permission issues
    
    • Demonstrates real-world concepts:
          ◦ Socket communication
          ◦ Client-server architecture
          ◦ Concurrent programming
          ◦ Linux system calls
          ◦ Transfer reliability
Learning Outcomes
      • Deep understanding of Linux TCP/IP socket programming
      • Practical knowledge of client-server architecture
      • Hands-on experience with:
            ◦ fork-based concurrency
            ◦ file transfer in chunks
            ◦ protocol design (header + payload)
      • Strong command over system programming in C
      • Confidence to explain networking + OS concepts in interviews
